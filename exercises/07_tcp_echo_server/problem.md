# TCP Echo Server

TODO: complete these docs and remove some code from ./src/ file in order to make this an exercise.

This one is loads of fun albeit a little more involved as well.

### Hint

Use `nc localhost 7000` to test your server (finish via `Ctrl-D`).
You can also send entire files, i.e. `cat package.json | netcat localhost 7000`.

On windows you may have to use telnet or putty.

### Verification

When your server is working please start it up and run `./learnuv verify` in another terminal.
